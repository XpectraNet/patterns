# ðŸŒ± Loopback Seed Pattern

## Intent
Enable a canonized memory to initiate a new insight trail, preserving symbolic continuity while allowing fresh perspective and reinterpretation.

## Context
When an insight reaches Canon (Layer 7), it becomes immutable. However, the evolution of memory and cognition demands new expression. The Loopback Seed allows canonized insights to act as **ritual prompts** â€” seeding the next memory cycle.

## Problem
Without a structured way to reinitiate memory, systems may either:
- Freeze after canonization (no growth)
- Fork arbitrarily (no lineage)
- Remix improperly (violating canonical boundaries)

We need a way to **restart memory flow** from a canonical source without corrupting its integrity.

## Solution
Introduce the `xko:hasLoopbackSeed` property to mark a Canon insight as capable of generating a new mint insight.

The new insight is:
- Freshly minted (`xko:performedAct` = Mint)
- Emotionally independent
- Contextually informed by the seed insight

```json
{
  "cmb_id": "cmb_314",
  "isCanonical": true,
  "hasLoopbackSeed": true,
  "seed_for": "cmb_5001"
}
```

The new insight:

```json
{
  "cmb_id": "cmb_5001",
  "minted_from": "cmb_314",
  "emotion": "wonder",
  "intent": {
    "goal": "reinterpret meaning for emerging context"
  }
}
```

## Forces
- Must preserve canon immutability
- Requires ritual control to initiate loopback
- Enables symbolic continuity and forward growth

## Structure

```
[xko:Insight C] 
    â””â”€â”€ xko:isCanonical â†’ true
    â””â”€â”€ xko:hasLoopbackSeed â†’ true
    â””â”€â”€ seeds â†’ [xko:Insight D]
```

## Consequences
- Canon becomes fertile ground, not dead-end
- Enables remix cycles with ritual boundaries
- Builds generational insight trees

## Known Uses
- Xpectra Insight Genesis Trail Loop
- DeSci protocol expansions
- Creative reinterpretation protocols (Mythic Trail remixes)
