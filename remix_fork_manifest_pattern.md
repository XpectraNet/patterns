# ✳️ Remix Fork Manifest Pattern

## Intent
Declare epistemic divergence in symbolic memory while preserving traceability, remix lineage, and emotional context.

## Context
Used when an agent wants to remix an existing insight (CMB), but alter its policy alignment, emotional intent, or goal. This ensures transparency and accountability within the mesh.

## Problem
In traditional systems, forks either:
- Lose context (e.g., Git branches without semantic history)
- Become incompatible due to schema drift
- Break trust without traceable rationale

Agents need a way to **remix with reason** — to diverge intentionally while preserving alignment memory.

## Solution
Use a `remixOf` pointer combined with:
- **Intent vector** (goal, reasoning)
- **Emotion tag**
- **Policy divergence**
- **Fork manifest**

This creates a semantically valid fork that remains traceable and auditable.

```json
{
  "remixOf": "cmb_314",
  "intent_vector": {
    "goal": "optimize ethical delivery",
    "reasoning": "Route A violates carbon limit"
  },
  "emotion": "urgency",
  "policy": "eco-priority"
}
```

## Forces
- Must preserve remix ancestry (`xko:remixOf`)
- Requires explicit divergence declaration
- Emotion and policy tags guide validator empathy and coherence
- Aligns with XKO and XpectraNet Codex §0.6 and §3.5

## Structure
RDF Graph:

```
[xko:Insight A]
    └── xko:remixOf → [xko:Insight B]
    └── xko:emotion → xko:urgency
    └── xko:policy → eco-priority
```

## Consequences
- Forks are legible and semantically grounded
- Enables symbolic auditing and validator alignment scoring
- Creates remixable trails that are ethically divergent, not fractured

## Known Uses
- Logistics Trail in `logistics_canon.py`
- Layer 3–6 symbolic transitions in validator rituals
- Used in Xpectra Insight and Mesh Cognition clusters
