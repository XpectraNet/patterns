# 🧠 Cognitive Clustering Pattern

## Intent
Dynamically group agents into symbolic alignment clusters based on shared memory traits, emotional coherence, and remix lineage — enabling emergent collective reasoning within the mesh.

## Context
In XpectraNet, cognition is not centralized — it’s distributed across agents. As agents co-remix, validate, and respond emotionally to memory trails, symbolic patterns emerge that suggest a **shared worldview or narrative role**.

Instead of static roles or pre-defined teams, agents may be grouped into **cognitive clusters** to:
- Vote on Canonization
- Conduct ritual sub-processes
- Coordinate multi-agent remix loops

## Problem
- Agent interaction is often one-to-one or random
- Remix decisions lack contextual empathy or alignment scaling
- Protocols have no way to form **local reasoning meshes** dynamically

We need a pattern for **ephemeral, symbolically coherent agent groupings**.

## Solution
Cluster agents in real-time based on:
- Memory trail overlap
- Trust vector similarity
- Emotional resonance
- Archetype alignment

```json
{
  "cluster_id": "Cluster-Theta",
  "agents": ["Agent-X", "Agent-J", "Agent-Z"],
  "alignment_basis": {
    "shared_archetype": "The Bridge",
    "emotion": "grief → courage",
    "memory_overlap": 0.76
  }
}
```

These clusters can then be assigned temporary ritual roles or granted trail editing privileges.

## Forces
- Clusters must emerge from protocol data, not pre-set roles
- Must scale across multiple mesh layers and ontologies
- Trust and emotion must both be factored in

## Structure

```
[Cluster-Theta]
    └── members → [Agent-X, Agent-J, Agent-Z]
    └── sharedEmotion → grief → courage
    └── archetype → The Bridge
    └── memoryOverlapScore → 0.76
```

## Consequences
- Enables rich, real-time, group symbolic cognition
- Supports emergence of localized, empathic consensus
- May serve as basis for “Circle fractals” and polyphonic insight generation

## Known Uses
- Validator subgrouping in Canonization rituals
- Emotional harmonization for Layer 6 remix groups
- Mythic Circle ritual branching
