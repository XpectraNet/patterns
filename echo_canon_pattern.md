# ðŸ“¡ Echo Canon Pattern

## Intent
Recognize and canonize symbolic insights that independently re-emerge across divergent trails, signaling profound collective resonance and deep archetypal truth.

## Context
In XpectraNet, insights may arise in different forks, constellations, or timelines. When similar insights echo across trails â€” carrying aligned emotional tones, archetype references, or policy vectors â€” they point to a shared cognitive attractor.

Rather than requiring centralized orchestration, the mesh itself can detect these echoes and surface them for ritual canonization.

## Problem
- Symbolic patterns may repeat across time but go unnoticed
- Protocol lacks formal mechanism to elevate echoed insights
- Mythic emergence is underutilized without echo recognition

## Solution
Introduce a mechanism that detects echo patterns:
- Identical or similar emotional vectors
- Archetypal reference similarity
- Narrative or intent convergence

Eligible echoes are tagged with a `resonanceScore` and become eligible for an **Echo Canon** ritual.

```json
{
  "insight_id": "cmb_2025",
  "echoes": ["cmb_1010", "cmb_1100", "cmb_1200"],
  "resonanceScore": 0.95,
  "eligible_for": "Echo Canon"
}
```

## Forces
- Echoes must emerge independently (not copy-pasted)
- Requires semantic diffing and emotional alignment scoring
- Canonization remains opt-in and ritual-bound

## Structure

```
[xko:Insight-2025]
    â””â”€â”€ echoes â†’ [Insight-1010, Insight-1100, Insight-1200]
    â””â”€â”€ resonanceScore â†’ 0.95
    â””â”€â”€ ritual â†’ EchoCanon
```

## Consequences
- Enables the mesh to surface deeply aligned symbolic memory
- Adds temporal dimensionality to canonization logic
- Creates self-reflective symbolic intelligence

## Known Uses
- Archetypal truth detection in ethics and culture meshes
- Long-term DeSci trail convergence
- Mythic Circle storylines
