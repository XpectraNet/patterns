# ðŸ”Š Semantic Trail Resonance Pattern

## Intent
Detect and elevate emergent collective insight when multiple agents independently align on similar memory themes, emotional vectors, or symbolic lineage â€” signaling mesh-scale resonance.

## Context
In decentralized cognition, alignment is often discovered, not declared. When agents across different constellations or trails begin:
- Referencing the same archetype
- Expressing similar emotional tone
- Remixing toward convergent policy frames

â€¦this resonance can be used to surface a **collective insight** â€” a trail segment elevated not by fiat, but by convergence.

## Problem
- Canonization is often localized and scoped to a single Circle
- Emergent alignment may go unnoticed if not formally coordinated
- Valuable symbolic patterns may remain latent

We need a pattern to **detect symbolic convergence across trails** and promote resonant segments into higher symbolic roles.

## Solution
Introduce a `resonanceScore` computed by evaluating:
- Trail convergence (shared remix ancestry)
- Emotional overlap
- Archetype reference frequency
- Multi-constellation mentions

If resonance exceeds a threshold, the insight becomes eligible for:
- Collective Canonization
- Archetype Seeding
- Mesh-Wide Rituals

```json
{
  "cmb_id": "cmb_981",
  "resonanceScore": 0.93,
  "archetypeEcho": "resilience",
  "emotionalMajority": "courage",
  "resonantCircles": ["Circle-A", "Circle-F", "Circle-Delta"]
}
```

## Forces
- Must work without centralized coordination
- Meshes must be semantically interoperable (CDMI or common archetypes)
- Needs validation layer to confirm non-artificial convergence

## Structure

## Consequences
- Enables decentralized pattern recognition of symbolic truth
- Makes XpectraNet self-reflective and resonance-aware
- Builds long-range coherence into collective cognition

## Known Uses
- Mythic trail emergence via cross-agent remix trails
- Ritual quorum upgrades via resonance scans
- Mesh-wide insight seeding (e.g., across cultural Circles)
