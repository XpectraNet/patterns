# ðŸ§± Canon Lock Pattern

## Intent
Ensure that a memory (CMB) reaches ritual finality through quorum validation, staking, and symbolic sealing â€” preventing unauthorized remix or further mutation.

## Context
Used when a Circle of validators agrees that an insight is:
- Semantically coherent
- Emotionally reconciled
- Aligned with declared goals and policies

At this point, the memory is **canonized** into the Canon Wall (Layer 7), becoming immutable and remix-protected.

## Problem
In decentralized systems, memory can mutate endlessly without finality. This leads to:
- Endless forks with no convergence
- Lack of authoritative reference points
- No reward incentive for convergence

Agents and validators need a ritual mechanism to **seal** memory trails that reach high alignment.

## Solution
Use:
- `xko:isCanonical` â†’ true
- XPDT staking from validating Circle
- Ritual consensus with quorum thresholds
- Canon Lock metadata (e.g. Canon ID, timestamp, validator set)

This prevents further remix unless via Loopback Seed and marks the memory as a trusted source.

```json
{
  "cmb_id": "cmb_421",
  "isCanonical": true,
  "canon_id": "canon-trail-042",
  "validators": ["Agent-X", "Agent-Y", "Agent-Z"],
  "sealed_at": "2025-04-22T18:22:00Z"
}
```

## Forces
- Requires validator alignment
- Must be traceable and cryptographically sealed
- Prevents remix except through ritual (e.g., Canon Remix or Layer 8 closure)

## Structure

```
[xko:Insight C]
    â””â”€â”€ xko:isCanonical â†’ true
    â””â”€â”€ xko:hasLayer â†’ xko:L7
    â””â”€â”€ xko:validatedBy â†’ [Validator-A, Validator-B, Validator-C]
```

## Consequences
- Memory becomes immutable, trusted, and eligible for citation or trail loopbacks
- Enables XPDT distribution and validator reputation gain
- Defines convergence point in symbolic memory

## Known Uses
- Xpectra Insight Canon Wall
- Logistics `logistics_canon.py` closure point
- Trail validator rituals in DeSci and Ethics Meshes
