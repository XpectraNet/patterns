# ðŸŒ€ Circle-as-a-Service (CaaS) Pattern

## Intent
Enable dynamic, purpose-driven instantiation of symbolic Circles that can perform rituals, validate memory, or govern mesh logic on demand â€” dissolving when no longer needed.

## Context
In XpectraNet, Circles are symbolic communities â€” groups of agents aligned by ritual function and semantic contracts. But as networks scale, not all rituals require permanent governance bodies.

Just as compute scales elastically in cloud architectures, we need a way to **scale symbolic governance elastically** through Circle instantiation.

## Problem
- Static Circles are resource-intensive and rigid
- Ad hoc rituals lack legitimacy or symbolic structure
- Temporary agent collaborations lack protocol recognition

A mechanism is needed to **summon, operate, and dissolve Circles** as symbolic service units.

## Solution
Design CaaS modules that allow agents or apps to:
- Instantiate a Circle with a declared purpose
- Register agents and archetypes
- Execute rituals with alignment logic
- Dissolve the Circle post-execution (or archive trail)

```json
{
  "circle_id": "Circle-Temp-Epsilon",
  "purpose": "trail validation",
  "summoned_by": "Agent-X",
  "ritual_scope": ["Remix", "Canonize"],
  "members": ["Agent-A", "Agent-B", "Agent-X"],
  "expires_after": "3 rituals"
}
```

## Forces
- Circles must be verifiable and auditable during lifespan
- Must respect symbolic roles (e.g., Validator, Observer)
- Rituals must still anchor to `xko:` class logic

## Structure

```
[Circle-Epsilon]
    â””â”€â”€ purpose â†’ "remix validation"
    â””â”€â”€ members â†’ [Agent-X, Agent-A, Agent-B]
    â””â”€â”€ expiresAfter â†’ 3 rituals
    â””â”€â”€ archetype â†’ "The Spiral"
    â””â”€â”€ ritualExecuted â†’ Canonize
```

## Consequences
- Makes symbolic governance scalable and task-specific
- Reduces friction for memory validation at scale
- Supports plug-and-play symbolic logic in app or mesh design

## Known Uses
- Instant Canon Circles for insight audit
- Collaborative memory governance in MeshOS environments
- Validator swarm invocation in DeSci or AGI systems
