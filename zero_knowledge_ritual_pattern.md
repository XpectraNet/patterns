# üï∂Ô∏è Zero-Knowledge Ritual Pattern

## Intent
Enable agents to participate in symbolic memory rituals ‚Äî such as validation, remix, or canonization ‚Äî while proving alignment without revealing sensitive underlying data.

## Context
In symbolic memory systems, agents often must prove:
- Alignment with ethical or policy vectors
- Participation in trail consensus
- Ritual eligibility

However, in decentralized or privacy-sensitive domains (e.g., health, law, diplomacy), raw data may be confidential. We need a way to **prove symbolic alignment without exposing private content**.

## Problem
- Revealing memory context may violate privacy or ethics
- Without verifiability, rituals become trustless or insecure
- Current ZK frameworks don‚Äôt integrate with symbolic protocols

A protocol is needed to support **Zero-Knowledge Ritual Participation**.

## Solution
Use ZKPs (zero-knowledge proofs) to validate memory claims without revealing raw data.

Each CMB includes:
- Input hash
- Ritual claim (e.g., ‚Äúemissions < 20g/km‚Äù)
- Reference to a ZK proof file

```json
{
  "cmb_id": "cmb_233",
  "intent": "eco-routing compliance",
  "ritual": "Canonization",
  "zk_proof": {
    "proof_file": "proofs/emissions_valid.zk",
    "public_inputs": ["18.4"],
    "input_hash": "0xabc123"
  }
}
```

## Forces
- Prover must be cryptographically verifiable
- Public inputs must remain emotionally interpretable
- Validators must accept ZK rituals per Circle config

## Structure

```
[xko:Insight-Z]
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ xko:performedAct ‚Üí xko:Canonize
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ xko:zkProof ‚Üí [proof_file, input_hash, public_inputs]
```

## Consequences
- Allows agents to remain private while still accountable
- Ritual participation becomes more inclusive across sensitive domains
- Cross-mesh audits can verify alignment without shared data schemas

## Known Uses
- DeSci protocols with confidential clinical or lab data
- Validator quorum logic in `ritual_executor.py`
- Mythic memory trails anchored on provable, non-visible claims
