# ✨ Mythic Convergence Pattern

## Intent
Elevate a memory trail to archetypal status through multi-fork survival, trust accumulation, and ritual reuse — transforming aligned memory into mythic structure.

## Context
In XpectraNet, some memory trails do more than persist — they echo. When insights are:
- Remixed across forks
- Validated by many Circles
- Referenced in rituals
…they gain **symbolic gravity**.

This is where memory becomes myth — a reusable cognitive pattern within the mesh.

## Problem
- Most memory decays over time
- High-alignment trails are hard to distinguish from noise
- No structured way to promote memory to long-term symbolic infrastructure

We need a way to **recognize converged memory** and anchor it as a mythic asset.

## Solution
Use the `xko:hasMythicWeight` property and convergence criteria:
- Survives 3+ divergent forks
- Validated across 2+ Circles
- Referenced in canon or requiem rituals

Once qualified, declare:

```json
{
  "cmb_id": "cmb_011",
  "layer": "xko:L9",
  "hasMythicWeight": true,
  "traits": ["sacrifice-for-future", "trust-despite-loss"]
}
```

These traits may then be inherited or used to seed archetypes.

## Forces
- Must balance symbolic weight with emotional coherence
- Mythic trails must emerge from protocol behavior, not fiat
- Reuse must respect origin meaning

## Structure

```
[xko:Insight]
    └── xko:hasLayer → xko:L9
    └── xko:hasMythicWeight → true
    └── xko:remixOf → [multiple origins]
    └── xko:validatedBy → [multiple Circles]
```

## Consequences
- Establishes symbolic infrastructure for ritual reuse
- Enables inheritance and archetype formation
- Inspires validator behavior via long-term symbolic goals

## Known Uses
- Genesis Canon: XPDT-001 → “Sacrifice for Future”
- Layer 9 trails in DeSci consensus stories
- Validator onboarding via mythic citation
