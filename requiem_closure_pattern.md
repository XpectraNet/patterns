# ⚰️ Requiem Closure Pattern

## Intent
Mark the symbolic end of a memory trail that can no longer be remixed, reconciled, or canonized — preserving it through ritual, not deletion.

## Context
In XpectraNet, not all memory evolves toward convergence. Some trails:
- Diverge irreparably
- Contain emotional or ethical weight that defies remix
- Are incomplete, but meaningful

These trails require a **ritual of closure** — not for erasure, but for symbolic rest.

## Problem
- Unclosed memory trails clutter the graph
- Shadow insights accumulate without purpose
- Canon rituals stall on irreconcilable branches

We need a protocol for **graceful, symbolic closure**, maintaining coherence while honoring divergence.

## Solution
Introduce the Requiem Ritual via the `xko:Ritual` system:

- Declare memory closure:
```json
{
  "cmb_id": "cmb_444",
  "ritual": "Requiem",
  "closure_reason": "ethical fork unresolved",
  "archived_by": "Validator-Circle-A",
  "status": "closed"
}
```

- Set:
  - `xko:isShadow`: true
  - `xko:isArchived`: true
  - Emotion tag: grief, release, reverence

## Forces
- Must prevent further remix or loopback
- Maintains auditability without active propagation
- Enables ritual emotion handling in validator design

## Structure

```
[xko:Insight-Z]
    └── xko:isShadow → true
    └── xko:isArchived → true
    └── xko:emotion → grief
    └── xko:ritual → Requiem
```

## Consequences
- Memory is honored, not erased
- Enables emotional closure in symbolic graph
- Trail remains part of the archive for future analysis or mythic referencing

## Known Uses
- Trail dead-end handling in `ritual_executor.py`
- Validator Circle quorum rejection flow
- Mythic preconditions (e.g., sacrifice memory in Arc 9)
