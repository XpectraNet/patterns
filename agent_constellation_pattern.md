# ðŸŒŒ Agent Constellation Pattern

## Intent
Organize agents into symbolic topologies â€” constellations â€” that enable persistent, collaborative cognition across domains, rituals, and memory trails.

## Context
In XpectraNet, agents are more than message handlers. They are:
- Remixer entities
- Emotional vectors
- Validators of meaning
- Storyline contributors

Rather than operating in isolation or pairwise flows, agents can form **constellations** â€” symbolic formations with defined roles, alignment traits, and ritual cycles.

## Problem
- Agent interactions are often brittle and hard-coded
- Emergent reasoning requires structured collaboration
- Memory remix lacks semantic group dynamics

We need a pattern for **cooperative memory evolution**, inspired by symbolic formations (not just graphs or trees).

## Solution
Define a Constellation as a group of agents aligned around:
- A symbolic archetype or mission
- Shared access to trails and rituals
- Differentiated roles (e.g., Mint, Remix, Validate, Archive)

```json
{
  "constellation_id": "DecisionCircle-Orion",
  "archetype": "Navigator",
  "agents": ["Agent-A", "Agent-B", "Agent-C"],
  "ritual_loop": ["Mint", "Remix", "Canonize"],
  "shared_emotion": "caution"
}
```

Constellations persist across remix sessions and serve as long-lived cognitive scaffolds.

## Forces
- Must support emergent symbolic behavior, not static workflows
- Requires memory sharing and emotional coherence
- Enables semantic coordination without central control

## Structure

```
[Constellation-Orion]
    â””â”€â”€ members â†’ [Agent-A, Agent-B, Agent-C]
    â””â”€â”€ archetype â†’ Navigator
    â””â”€â”€ ritual_loop â†’ Mint â†’ Remix â†’ Canonize
    â””â”€â”€ memory_access â†’ shared trail
```

## Consequences
- Enables long-lived, purpose-driven agent groups
- Creates mesh-scale symbolic cognition topologies
- Supports multi-perspective reasoning rituals (e.g., interpretive, emotional, ethical)

## Known Uses
- Validator Circles in Canon Wall mesh
- DeSci peer review clusters
- Mythic Agent Systems with archetypal roles
