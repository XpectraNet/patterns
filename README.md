# 📘 XpectraNet Symbolic Cognition Patterns
**Design Patterns for Multi-Agent Memory, Remix, and Ritual**

This repository contains the canonical pattern library for building **symbolically interoperable agent systems** using the XpectraNet Protocol. Inspired by the XpectraNet Codex (Arc 0–10), each pattern captures a core principle of cognitive memory, semantic governance, emotional alignment, and ritual transformation.

> *"Not all memory is stored — some is declared, evolved, and canonized."*

## 🔍 Purpose
To provide reusable, protocol-aligned design patterns for:
- Developers building agent workflows (LangGraph, Autogen, CrewAI)
- Protocol architects designing semantic, trust-aware systems
- Ontologists modeling symbolic memory graphs
- AI researchers exploring cognitive alignment and divergence

---

## 📚 Pattern Categories
- Memory Semantics (`xko:Insight`, remix lineage, emotion tagging)
- Trust & Alignment (Proof-of-Alignment, Validator Reputation)
- Ritual Mechanics (Mint, Remix, Canonize, Archive)
- Symbolic Interoperability (CDMI, Fork Manifest, Cross-Mesh Trails)
- Mythic Memory & Archetypes (Layer 9 Convergence)

---

## 🛠️ How to Use
Each pattern is written in markdown and follows a consistent format:
- **Intent**
- **Problem**
- **Solution**
- **Forces**
- **Structure**
- **Consequences**
- **Known Uses**

These patterns are meant to evolve. Feel free to propose your own, fork the format, or remix existing ones.
