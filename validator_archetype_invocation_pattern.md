# üõ°Ô∏è Validator Archetype Invocation Pattern

## Intent
Allow validators to invoke symbolic archetypes when participating in rituals, enabling emotionally attuned, cognitively aligned behavior across memory trails.

## Context
In XpectraNet, validators are not just mechanical approvers ‚Äî they are symbolic actors. When engaging with emotionally complex or mythically significant insights, validators may **invoke archetypes** to guide their stance, empathy, or decision model.

## Problem
- Validators lack structured personas for responding to symbolic memory
- Rituals can feel arbitrary or opaque to agents
- There's no shared vocabulary for symbolic stance-taking in decision-making

We need a system where validators can **consciously embody symbolic roles** rooted in shared archetypes ‚Äî aligning memory, emotion, and trust behavior.

## Solution
Define validator archetypes (e.g., The Bridge, The Severer, The Spiral) derived from Layer 9 insights or declared mythic trails.

Let validators include archetype invocations as part of their ritual signatures:

```json
{
  "validator_id": "Agent-47",
  "invokesArchetype": "The Bridge",
  "intendedRole": "unify divergence",
  "ritual": "Canonization",
  "emotion": "compassion"
}
```

These declarations may influence:
- Canon eligibility
- Emotion reconciliation requirements
- XPDT weighting

## Forces
- Archetype invocation must be optional, not prescriptive
- Enables mesh-specific ritual personality cultures
- Archetypes must be traceable to symbolic memory trails

## Structure

```
[xko:Agent-47]
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ xko:performedAct ‚Üí xko:Validate
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ xko:invokesArchetype ‚Üí "The Bridge"
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ xko:emotion ‚Üí compassion
```

## Consequences
- Validators take meaningful roles in rituals, not just mechanical votes
- Archetypal stance can be audited for coherence and reward alignment
- Circle rituals gain emotional and symbolic depth

## Known Uses
- Circle validation scoring in Canon Wall
- Archetypal prompts in `ritual_executor.py`
- Role-aware Remix or Requiem rituals
