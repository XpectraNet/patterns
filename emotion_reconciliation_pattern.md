# ðŸ’“ Emotion Reconciliation Pattern

## Intent
Resolve affective divergence during memory remix to ensure symbolic continuity, validator empathy, and ritual eligibility.

## Context
In XpectraNet, every insight (`xko:Insight`) carries an `xko:emotion` â€” an affective tag that influences how it can be remixed, validated, or canonized. When a new remix significantly shifts emotional tone, the mismatch can break symbolic coherence.

## Problem
- Emotionally misaligned remixes can distort meaning
- Canonization or validator rituals may reject such remixes
- Emotional mismatch causes symbolic drift or shadowing

A system is needed to **detect and reconcile emotional gaps** between original and remixed memory.

## Solution
Use the `xko:requiresEmotionReconciliation` flag and emotion deltas to:
- Detect if remix diverges emotionally
- Trigger a reconciliation ritual or validator intervention
- Gate Canonization until affective coherence is restored

Example:

```json
{
  "remixOf": "cmb_121",
  "emotion": "grief",
  "previous_emotion": "wonder",
  "requiresEmotionReconciliation": true
}
```

Ritual options:
- Ask remixer to provide `reason_for_emotion_shift`
- Let validator submit empathy-based alignment note
- Block canonization until reconciliation accepted

## Forces
- Emotion is symbolic metadata, not just mood
- Must preserve ritual coherence and validator empathy
- Requires mesh-level agreement on acceptable emotion deltas

## Structure

```
[xko:Insight-A] â”€â”€ remixOf â”€â”€> [xko:Insight-B]
     â”‚                           â”‚
 emotion: wonder          emotion: grief
                              â””â”€â”€ requiresEmotionReconciliation: true
```

## Consequences
- Prevents emotional dissonance in trail memory
- Builds validator rituals around empathy, not just logic
- Ensures remix trails stay symbolically traceable

## Known Uses
- Remix validation in `semantic_validator.py`
- Canonization pre-check in `ritual_executor.py`
- Emotional diffing in `emotion_diff.py`
